Why did I decide to study Software Engineering? Family, Future, and Freedom,  and I call these my three "F's", for why I decided to study Software Engineering.  My first "F" is family,  and my family is a big part of who I am. My family is a part of what drives me to want to become a Software Engineer.  I often look at my family,  and they often motivate me to want to be able to conquer the world, not just for myself, but for them also.  My next "F" is my future,  and this is another part of what drives me to become a successful Software Engineer.  A few months ago I started researching more about how to become a Tech professional. I wanted to secure my future,  with a career that I thought would be exciting,  innovative,  and something that I would enjoy doing. As I researched more and more,  I came across Software Engineering.  My conclusion after researching,  was that Software Engineering is my future. I like that you have the ability to create,  and through creating,  you also have the ability to overcome challenges.  I consider myself a very resilient person when faced with challenges. My last "F" is freedom. I like having the freedom of being able to use the skill set as a Software Engineer, to find a career in every professional industry. I believe Software Engineering is not only just a career,  but it is a key to unlock my future and a vehicle for me to provide for my family. I am looking forward to my exciting  journey as a Software Engineer.
